We covered a diverse range of authors, topics, and approaches, with a relatively strong presence of feminist philosophy of science and social epistemology. We have explored topics such as strong objectivity and well-ordered science, epistemic oppression, disadvantage, epistemic justice and injustice in science, extractivism, multiculturalism, digital colonialism, formal models of diversity, open science, science funding, values in science, and diversity work in academia.</p> <p>Epistemic diversity carves deep channels into foundational terrain of knowledge, scientific progress, equity, and justice. It is also deeply personal territory for us as researchers, whose own perspectives and standpoints are embedded in the landscapes we study. The field itself is also contested, and direct threats to diversity in academia are only becoming more apparent. </p> <p>As we wandered through the wilderness, we found ourselves lost in a multitudinous landscape of concepts, theories and hypotheses. What we needed was a cartographer, someone to chart the variety of frameworks, draw connections between scattered regions of thought, and help us navigate the broader terrain.</p> <p>This is where concept cartography helped. Several of us took on the role of cartographers, beginning by writing a dictionary of terms that gradually evolved into a conceptual map. We traced the contours of our reading list, extracting definitions, characterisations, examples, and conceptual routes between ideas. We also added additional landmarks from political epistemology.</p> <p>The result is a representation of conceptual space: a topography of concepts, theories, and hypotheses and their interlinkages. The terrain is intricate, and like any map, ours offers only a  partial perspective. Yet we hope it serves as a navigational aid for those exploring the intellectual landscapes surrounding epistemic diversity. </p> <p>We invite you to engage with the chart for your thinking and teaching. Take it in hand as is, or shape it and add to it to suit your needs and experiences. You may even want to create your own map. </p>"},{"location":"relation-types/","title":"Relation types","text":"<p>The map doesn\u2019t just show concepts, it also traces the relationships between them. These relation types help to clarify how ideas have been connected through our conversations. They are not meant to be authoritative or final, but reflect how we, as a group of researchers, have made sense of the terrain together.</p> <p>Like any chart, this map reflects choices we made, such as which relation types to include and when to merge similar ones for clarity. Each relation is given a definition, a brief example, and whether it is bi-directional (i.e., whether the relation holds in both directions).

For example, produces also includes give rise to and causes; part of includes constitutes and subset of; and distinct from includes separate in function or meaning.</p> <p>This space is open-ended: relation types can be added or revised as the map evolves.

How does that matter both for what and how we know, and for recognition, equity, and justice?

Like all maps, this one is a single perspective on a complicated terrain. It is non-exhaustive. It connects ideas, rather than citations. It aims to give a sense for the diversity of voices and areas where these topics come up, while acknowledging that there is so much more to see and do between and beyond the points we depict.</p> <p>You can use this map to navigate the conceptual space, trace conceptual lineages and interrelations, and explore definitions and references. Take it as a starting point, a piece of equipment for orienting your thinking. At the same time, we hope that the map will preserve some disorientation: that it will raise questions, disrupt standard narratives, and create a sense of discomfort at its own inadequacy.</p> <p>This map was created based primarily on readings from an interdisciplinary, international, online reading group, beginning in mid-2024.
