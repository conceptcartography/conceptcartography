This map is a device for orientation in the complex intellectual landscape of epistemic diversity. It does not claim to chart definitively, but rather offers a guide to explore how ideas might be connected, to locate ongoing debates, and to identify areas for deeper inquiry. 

Use the map to locate a concept you’re curious about, such as epistemic injustice, diversity development work, interlacing, well-ordered science. Each node functions like a search result, pointing you to relevant definitions, examples, and references. 

If you’re **referencing a concept or definition** you found on the map, please cite the original source(s) listed in the node.

If you're **referencing a relationship between concepts** (e.g., “epistemic death is similar to epistemic oppression”), we ask that you cite the map itself as the source of that interpretation.

The map is a living document. Its terrain is continually updated, and we warmly invite you to help expand or revise it. We encourage you to debate the connections between concepts, create sub-maps around specific themes (e.g., the epistemology of ignorance), and annotate the landscape with your own insights. In doing so, you contribute to a shared effort to navigate and make sense of this rich and evolving field.

For instructions on how to add or suggest revisions to the map, visit our Participation Protocols.
