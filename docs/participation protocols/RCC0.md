# RCC0: Referencing Concept Cartography 

_The map is a living document. Its terrain is continually updated, and we warmly invite you to help expand or revise it. We encourage you to debate the connections between concepts, create sub-maps around specific themes (e.g., the epistemology of ignorance), and annotate the landscape with your own insights. In doing so, you contribute to a shared effort to navigate and make sense of this rich and evolving field._

If you‚Äôre **referencing a concept or definition** you found on the map, please cite the original source(s) listed in the node.

If you're **referencing a relationship between concepts** (e.g., ‚Äúepistemic death is similar to epistemic oppression‚Äù), we ask that you cite the map itself as the source of that interpretation.
