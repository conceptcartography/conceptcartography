Proctor has called “agnotology”—the study of culturally-induced ignorances—that serves as a counterweight to more traditional concerns for epistemology. Agnotology refocuses questions about “how we know” to include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle. Nature, after all, is infinitely rich and variable. What we know or do not know at any one time or place is shaped by particular histories, local and global priorities, funding patterns, institutional and disciplinary hierarchies, personal and professional myopia, and much else as well\" (Schiebinger 2004, 3).",

The former requires that agents aim to produce a certain range of values that are relevant for the purpose, that they ‘exercise knowledge of how’ to produce a result with the relevant values (Gaut 2018, 131–2), and exhibit ‘an evaluative ability directed to the task at hand’ (Gaut 2010, 1040). Another way of putting this is to say that creative making ‘must involve flair’ in producing something valuable and original (Gaut 2003, 151). Hence, accidentally spilling a pot of paint and causing an aesthetically pleasing pattern on a canvas lying on the floor, for example, will not count as an instance of creativity. Flair, or directed control then, excludes purely by chance cases or mechanical search procedures (whereby one systematically works through all the relevant possibilities) which result in valuable novelty as being creative\" (Anscomb 2020, 8).",

What makes credibility or intelligibility deficits _undue_—that is, what makes them cases of epistemic _injustice_—is that these deficits in credibility or intelligibility stem from biases on the part of interlocutors in AAAP [Anglo-American analytic philosophy], rather than from a lack of competence or sincerity on the part of academic migrants.

As implied by the claim that they face epistemic injustice, and hence that the credibility or intelligibility deficits they face are undue, the idea here is not that non-native English users are somehow unable to perform well in AAAP.

Further, it is generally socially powerless groups that suffer hermeneutical marginalization, and so we can say that, from the moral point of view, what is bad about this sort of hermeneutical marginalization is that the structural prejudice it causes in the collective hermeneutical resource is essentially discriminatory: the prejudice affects people in virtue of their membership of a socially powerless group, and thus in virtue of an aspect of their social identity. It is, then, akin to identity prejudice. Let us call it _structural identity prejudice_.\" (Fricker 2007, 154-55).",
