# epistemic disadvantage

## 📖 Definitions

> "Epistemic disadvantage occurs when non-deliberate, asymmetrical relations exclude person(s) from social participation, leading  to an intellectual or moral harm. In other words, epistemic disadvantage marks when a person or group is warrantedly excluded from knowledge exchanges, but the exclusion results in an intellectual or moral harm." (Goldstein 2022, 1862)
