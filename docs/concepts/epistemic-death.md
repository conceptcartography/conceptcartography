- '"Under conditions of epistemic death, subjects owe nothing to those practices and
  communities that contribute to their annihilation; epistemic obligations (such as
  answering questions, telling the truth, sharing information, etc.) are suspended
  because one should not be expected to cooperate with practices that undermine one’s
  own status and agency or that of one’s fellows. Moreover, besides relaxing and suspending
  obligations, epistemic death also creates a right (if not a duty) to fight epistemically
  by any means necessary (including the right to lie, to hide, to sabotage, to silence
  others, etc.), demonstrating loyalty and solidarity only with alternatives epistemic
  communities (communities of resistance)" ([Medina, 2018, p. 255]).'
