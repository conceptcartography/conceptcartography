# epistemic extractivism

## 📖 Definitions

> "The key feature of an extractivist epistemology, I argue, is the way in which it treats this epistemic resource as separable from its origin, without subsequent loss, rendering it into a commodity with exchange value over which exclusive rights can be contractually defined, protected, and enforced" (Alcoff 2022, 5).

## 💡 Examples

- Patenting plant material
- Museum collections of artifacts and human remains
