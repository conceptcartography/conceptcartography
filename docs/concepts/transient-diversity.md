# transient diversity

## 📖 Definitions

> "This diversity should be around long enough so that individuals do not discard theories too quickly, but also not stay around so long as to hinder the convergence to one action." (Zollman 2010, 32)

## 💡 Examples

- "One way of achieving this diversity is to limit the amount (and content) of information provided to individuals. Another way is to make individuals’ priors extreme. However, these are not independent virtues. Both together make the diversity too stable, and result in a worse situation than either individually." (Zollman 2010, 33)

## 🔗 Relations
