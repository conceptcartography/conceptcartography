# the novelty tax

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "The epistemic approach to diversity is essentially an invitation to diverse practitioners to join a community and provide dissent, to point out implicit values and methodological inconsistencies and hence improve rigor. It is also, then, an invitation to introduce new questions and theories that lack a history within a community and hence provide novelty that increases the creativity of the community. It is an invitation based on the benefits of doing something additional to and different from the common activities of the communityâ€”to change the conversation. It should therefore be unsurprising that, in the academy, where established traditions often hold centrality, there are costs associated with this novelty." (Fehr and Jones 2022, 12)

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

- "For instance, it is easier to publish not only when a person is in a subject position that is granted credibility and intellectual respect but also when the personâ€™s research can comfortably fit into extant conversations." (Fehr and Jones 2022, 12)
