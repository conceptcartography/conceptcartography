# world traveling

## 📖 Definitions

- "there are 'worlds' that we can travel to lovingly and travelling to them is part of loving at least some of their inhabitants. The reason why I think that travelling to someone's 'world' is a way of identifying with them is because by travelling to their 'world' we can understand what it is to be them and what it is to be ourselves in their eyes. [...] Knowing other women's 'worlds' is part of knowing them and knowing them is part of loving them. [...] Without knowing the other's 'world,' one does not know the other and without knowing the other one is really alone in the other's presence because the other is only dimly present to one." (Lugones 1987, 17-18)
- crossing barriers by taking up resistant worlds of sense, resisting dominant relationality and understanding

## 💡 Examples

> Lugones describes the new understanding she had of her mother after travelling to her mother's "world": "I came to realize through travelling to her 'world' that she is not foldable and pliable, that she is not exhausted by the mainstream argentinian patriarchal construction of her. I came to realize that the are 'worlds' in which she shines as a creative being." (Lugones 1987, 18)
