  resources. To say that shared epistemic resources are insufficient is to point to
  limitations within those resources themselves." (Dotson, 2014, p. 127)'
- '"a second-order exclusion occurs when there are gaps in an epistemic system resulting
  from prior exclusions in the system’s development where these gaps consistently
  obscure what it is in the interests of particular knowers to know and have known.
  In such cases, a system will need to be more fully developed so as to facilitate
  epistemic agency more equitably." (Pohlhaus, 2020, p. 235)'
