# identity prejudice

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "The main type (the only type?) of prejudice that tracks people in this way is prejudice relating to social identity. Let us call this sort of prejudice identity prejudice. It can come in positive or negative formâ€”prejudice for or against people owing to some feature of their social identityâ€”but since our interest is in cases of credibility deficit rather than excess, we shall be concerned only with negative identity prejudice. (Indeed, I shall tend to use â€˜identity prejudiceâ€™ as short for â€˜negative identity prejudiceâ€™.)" (Fricker 2007, 27-28)
