# situational diversity

## 📖 Definitions

> "A community is situationally diverse when its membership consists of individuals with different social and material locations (gender, race, class, sexuality, etc.). [...] increasing situational diversity can and has led to increases in epistemic diversity, but it is not necessary that it do so" (Fehr, 2011, 146-47).
