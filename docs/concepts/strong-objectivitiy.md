# strong objectivitiy

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "in at least some cases scientific and philosophic research can be directed by recognizably political, social, and cultural values and interests and yet still be fair to the evidence and fair to its severest critics. These fairness requirements have been fundamental goals of any standard for maximizing objectivity. The need for strong objectivity arises when existing research communities are too homogenous and too isolated from pro-democratic social tendencies. Such research that starts from outside such homogenous communities can be directed by progressive social and political commitments and, because of the limitations of the existing scientific communities, can maximize objectivity more effectively than the existing, supposedly value-free communities." (Harding 2015, 23)
