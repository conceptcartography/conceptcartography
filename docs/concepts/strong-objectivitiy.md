  for strong objectivity arises when existing research communities are too homogenous
  and too isolated from pro-democratic social tendencies. Such research that starts
  from outside such homogenous communities can be directed by progressive social and
  political commitments and, because of the limitations of the existing scientific
  communities, can maximize objectivity more effectively than the existing, supposedly
  value-free communities." ([Harding, 2015, 23])'
