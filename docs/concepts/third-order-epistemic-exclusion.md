  activities in question. This kind of epistemic exclusion is different than firstor
  second-order exclusion, insofar as the latter is detected from within the shared
  epistemic resources themselves. Third-order epistemic exclusion proceeds from the
  “outside” of a set of epistemic resources to throw large portions of one’s epistemological
  system into question as a result of the goals of a given inquiry." (Dotson, 2014,
