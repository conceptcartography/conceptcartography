## 📖 Definitions

> "non-dominant hermeneutical marginalization describes unwarranted epistemic exclusions.

Mason 2011, 298).

## 💡 Examples

- "On Mason’s interpretation, [Carmita] Wood had adequate resources. She could make sense of her social experience, but those resources were not respected by the dominant group" (Goldstein 2022, 1865).
