# epistemic power

## 📖 Definitions

> "Epistemic power refers to relations of privilege and underprivileged afforded via different social positions, relevant resources and/or epistemological systems with respect to knowledge production. It is often bound up with social, political and economic power. However, it is distinct insofar as epistemic power can come apart from these other forms of power." (Dotson 2014, 125)
