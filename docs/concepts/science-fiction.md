> "Even if the work of science fiction is contributing nothing to instigating novel perspectives towards the science, it still opens up the way for thinking about how that science could provide novel insight into imagined futures and imagined technologies that emphasize much more novel possibilities to be had from the science rather than the novelty embodied by the science itself." (Lee 2019, 713)
