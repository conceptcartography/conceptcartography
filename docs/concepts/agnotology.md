  include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not
  merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle.
  Nature, after all, is infinitely rich and variable. What we know or do not know
  at any one time or place is shaped by particular histories, local and global priorities,
  funding patterns, institutional and disciplinary hierarchies, personal and professional
  myopia, and much else as well." (Schiebinger, 2004, p.3)'
