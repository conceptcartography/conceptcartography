# testimonial betrayal

## 📖 Definitions

> "In intimate relationships forged by thick relations of trust, parties seek each other’s approval, often including recognition of their opinions on matters arising in the course of their interactions. In the context of such relationships, seeking approval need not take the form of an explicit request for approval; one party may just assume that the other party will take their opinion seriously given their purported relationship. Failure by one party to accord the recognition sought implicitly may be experienced by the other party as a betrayal of that thick relationship." (Wanderer 2017, 37).

## 💡 Examples

- "When Sherwood tells Greenleaf of her suspicions about Ripley, she seeks out his approbation. His failure to believe her is experienced by her as rejection of their relationship, a rejection that exacerbates her own sense of isolation and powerlessness." (Wanderer 2017, 37)
