# epistemological resistance movement

## 📖 Definitions

> "In this sense, the women's health movement was an epistemological resistance movement geared at undermining the production of ignorance about women's health and women's bodies in order to critique and extricate women from oppressive systems often based on this ignorance, as well as creating liberatory knowledges.' While one aspect of the women's health movement was to make available to women basic medical knowledge that at that time was accessible only to health-care professionals, an equally important goal of the women's health movement was to reexamine traditional medicine, not simply in order to "get it right," but rather to transform our knowledge of women's bodies so as to remove oppression, to augment women's lives, and to transform society." (Tuana, 2006, p.2)
