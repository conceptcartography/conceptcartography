# epistemic freedom

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> " Epistemic freedom is about democratizing â€˜knowledgeâ€™ from its current rendition in the singular into its plural known as â€˜knowledgesâ€™. It is also ranged against overrepresentation of Eurocentric thought in knowledge, social theory and education. Epistemic freedom is foundational in the broader decolonization struggle because it enables the emergence of the necessary critical decolonial consciousness"  (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2018, 4).
