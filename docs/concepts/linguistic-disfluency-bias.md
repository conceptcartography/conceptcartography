# linguistic disfluency bias

## 📖 Definitions

> "cases in which detecting an LX accent, lexical choice, etc. leads an audience to biased conclusions because unfamiliar speech is harder to process fluently, producing negative affect that then influences cognition, [where LX refers to people who use a language as their second, third, fourth, etc. language]" (Peters 2024, 1516-17)

## 💡 Examples

- "e.g., listeners might judge a well understandable accented speaker as less competent because the accent interrupts their processing ease, not because of social prejudice specifically against LX users" (Peters 2024, 1517)

## 🔗 Relations
