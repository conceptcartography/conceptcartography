# linguistic disfluency bias

## 📖 Definitions

> "cases in which detecting an LX accent, lexical choice, etc. leads an audience to biased conclusions because unfamiliar speech is harder to process fluently, producing negative affect that then influences cognition" (Peters, 2024, p. 1517)

## 💡 Examples

- "e.g., listeners might judge a well understandable accented speaker as less competent because the accent interrupts their processing ease, not because of social prejudice specifically against LX users"

## 🔗 Relations
