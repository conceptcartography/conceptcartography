# epistemic oppression

## 📖 Definitions

> "Epistemic oppression refers to persistent epistemic exclusion that hinders one’s contribution to knowledge production. Epistemic exclusion, here, will be understood as an unwarranted infringement on the epistemic agency of knowers. Epistemic agency, in this analysis, refers to the ability to utilize persuasively shared epistemic resources within a given community of knowers in order to participate in knowledge production and, if required, the revision of those same resources." (Dotson, 2014, p. 115)

## 💡 Examples

- suppression and lack of uptake of black feminist thought
