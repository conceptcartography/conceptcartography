# non-dominant hermeneutical resources

## 📖 Definitions

> "non-dominant hermeneutical resources give marginalized subjects possibilities for self-understanding and articulation despite distortions and absences in dominant discourses of interpretation" (Mason 2011, 305).

## 💡 Examples

- "For instance, although dominant hermeneutical discourses were deficient with respect to women’s experiences of sexual harassment, this did not mean that non-dominant hermeneutical discoursesthose discourses that generated and were generated by the twentieth-century women’s movement—failed to provide women with the interpretive resources to understand and articulate their experiences of it. Certainly, when dominant discourses of interpretation neglect the experiences of marginalized groups, members of those groups suffer some injustice. However, because marginalized subjects may have non-dominant hermeneutical resources to draw upon in order to interpret their social experiences, gaps in dominant hermeneutical resources do not necessarily result in hermeneutical injustice" (Mason 2011, 300).
