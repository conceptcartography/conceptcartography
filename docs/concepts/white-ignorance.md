definitions:
- Systemic and socially constructed form of ignorance that sustains white supremacy
  by distorting, denying, or ignoring racial realities, highlighting how dominant
  racial groups often remain unaware—intentionally or unintentionally—of the injustices
  and experiences of marginalized groups, thereby maintaining racial inequality.

    \ since it typically concerns “a dysfunction at the level of belief and evidence\
    \ rather than the level of conceptual repertoire and intelligibility” ([Fricker,\
    \ 2016, p. 173]). However, she acknowledges that there can be cases of white ignorance\
    \ (“albeit non-standard”) that include “the suppression of concepts” and result\
    \ in “a genuine deficit in hermeneutical resources for the white community” ([Fricker,\
