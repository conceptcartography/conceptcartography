# interlacing

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "Scientific perspectives â€˜interlaceâ€™ in the sense that without ever losing their historical and cultural identity, they nevertheless _collectively_ feed into cosmopolitan knowledge. [...] â€˜interlacingâ€™ captures how historically a number of situated scientific perspectives have encountered and traded with one another some of their tools, instruments and techniques. As a result of these encounters and trades, some of these tools changed their _use_, so that tracking the particular history of any such tool via interlaced scientific perspectives becomes a way of tracking the evolution of knowledge concerning particular phenomena elicited by that tool" (Massimi 2022, 339-40).
