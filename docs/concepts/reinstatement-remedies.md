# reinstatement remedies

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "â€˜Reinstatement remediesâ€™ call for restoring the role and position from which these communities had been unjustly removed in scientific narratives. Reinstatement remedies take different forms. In what follows, I focus on three of them. They are inter-related and might be labelled as follows: reinstatement of authorship in the co-creation of knowledge, reinstatement of historical role in the production of knowledge, and reinstatement of intellectual ownership for scientific knowledge." (Massimi 2022, 352)
