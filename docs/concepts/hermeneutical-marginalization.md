# hermeneutical marginalization

## 📖 Definitions

> "Let us say that when there is unequal hermeneutical participation with respect to some significant area(s) of social experience, members of the disadvantaged group are hermeneutically marginalized." (Fricker, 2007, p. 153).

## 💡 Examples

- "Camita Wood experienced subtle microaggressions, groping, and forcible kissing by a distinguished professor at her place of employment. From the incidents, she developed somatic pain and was forced to quit her job. Wood applied for unemployment stating that she left for “personal reasons” (Fricker 2007: 150). Her claim was denied, however, since the termination cause was not considered justifiable at the time (pre-1970’s). Wood’s marginalized status, as a woman in a 1960’s workplace, meant that she was unable to stop the practice as it was not considered poor behavior by the institution or by broader social norms. Her status excluded her from communicating with those with social power (her employer). Eventually, Wood shared her experience with other women, who also reported similar interactions, which led to speak-outs and later filled a conceptual gap as women gave name to these negative social experiences: ‘sexual harassment’" (Goldstein 2022: 1863).
