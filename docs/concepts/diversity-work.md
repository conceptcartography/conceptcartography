# diversity work

## ðŸ“– Definitions

> "Diversity work might be the work you do when you disappear from the room. You have to work to appear. Or diversity work might be the requirement to give an account of yourself: how you got somewhere. Or diversity work might be the work you do to avoid the necessity of having to explain your arrival." (Ahmed, 2017, p. 127) "What I am calling diversity work involves transforming questions into a catalog. A catalog does not assume each question as the same question, but it is a way of hearing continuities and resonances" (Ahmed 2017,  132).
