The map doesn’t just show concepts, it also traces the relationships between them. These relation types help to clarify how ideas have been connected through our conversations. They are not meant to be authoritative or final, but reflect how we, as a group of researchers, have made sense of the terrain together.

Like any chart, this map reflects choices we made, such as which relation types to include and when to merge similar ones for clarity. Each relation is given a definition, a brief example, and whether it is bi-directional (i.e., whether the relation holds in both directions). Please read each relation type’s definition carefully, as we have listed synonyms. For example, _produces_ also includes _give rise to_ and _causes_; _part of_ includes _constitutes_ and _subset of_; and _distinct from_ includes _separate in function_ or _meaning_.

This space is open-ended: relation types can be added or revised as the map evolves. We welcome your suggestions for additional relation types as the conversation continues.

| Relations | Definitions | Examples | Bi-directional |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Part of  | Makes up or forms specific elements or parts; constitutes a component or subset of a whole. | --- | --- |
| Produces | Brings something into existence, gives rise to, or causes something to happen. | "Identity prejudice is never justified and ought not to inform whether non-dominant groups are included in knowledge exchanges. For this reason, identity prejudice gives rise to both testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice" (Goldstein 2022: 1864). |
| Counteracts | Acts to neutralize or reduce the effect of something, constrains, undermines, prevents. | --- | --- |
| Similar to | Shares characteristics or qualities with something else; matches or aligns in form, function or meaning; can be expressed in terms of. | --- | Y |
| Equivalent to | Has the same value, meaning, or function. | --- | Y |
| Distinct from/not | Not the same as; different or separate in nature, form, function or meaning; irreducible to. | "While the lenses provided above treat epistemic injustice as inextricable from social and political forms of oppression, Dotson utilizes a degree of change lens to argue that there are distinct forms of epistemic oppression that are not reducible to social and political factors, but rather derive from epistemic systems themselves (2014a: 116)" (Pohlhaus, in Varieties of Epistemic Injustice: 19). | Y |
| Depends on | Requires the presence or condition of something else, derives from, is a corollary of. | --- | --- |
| Coextensive with | Ranging over the same phenomena, yet highlighting different aspects. | "...the medical field’s insistence on procedures which heavily rely on arduous legal, medical, or academic terminologies exclude patients, or force them to adopt an epistemically marginal role in decision making during consultations (Kidd & Carel 2014: 520).Thus, some of the experiences of patients are coextensive with testimonial and hermeneutical injustices" (Goldstein 2022: 1871). | Y |
| Ranges over | Applies to or spans across a set of values or elements. | "The concept of hermeneutical injustice ranges over structural conceptual gaps that can prevent a speaker from communicating knowledge" (Alcalay 2024: 115) | --- |
